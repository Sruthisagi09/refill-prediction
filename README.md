# 🧪 Refill Prediction – ML Project

This project applies a basic machine learning model to predict whether a patient will refill their medication on time, based on features like age, gender, and refill gap days. It serves as an introductory project to build and deploy predictive models using real-world-inspired healthcare data.

## 📊 What It Does

- Loads and explores a small synthetic dataset of patients and their refill behavior
- Performs basic data preprocessing using pandas and one-hot encoding
- Trains a logistic regression model to classify refill behavior (on-time vs late)
- Evaluates the model with precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sruthisagi09/refill-prediction.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Refill_Prediction_Starter.ipynb
```

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Expand dataset with real or simulated features (e.g., chronic conditions, medication class)
- Try other models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Build a simple Flask or FastAPI app to deploy it
